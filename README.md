Return of the Trojans
=====================

This is the ITP 380 final project of Andrew Downing, Vansh Jain, and Zachary Metcalf. It is a team-based shooting game inspired by Star Wars: Battlefront II. The game is written in C# 2010, and uses Microsoft XNA Game Studio 4 Refresh (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=27599). To run it, open game-xna.sln and hit F5. You can control the player either by using the keyboard or an XBox 360 controller.

Our professor Sanjay Madhav wrote the initial code template and licensed it under the Microsoft Public License, and we made our changes on top of that template project. Since we're not artists, most of the models and sounds were either provided in the initial template or downloaded from http://scifi3d.com/. The ones that we downloaded from online are licensed under what the original authors licensed them under, which probably isn't the Microsoft Public License. (Unfortunately we don't have direct links to each resource we downloaded. If you made one and would like us to give you credit for it, create a GitHub issue and we'll add a notice to the readme.)
